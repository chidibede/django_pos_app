# django_pos_app
Rewriting the flask pos app in django
link: https://djangopos.herokuapp.com
The applicatiion which was intended to be a desktop app was developed using django web framework as
a point of sale application with inventory, accounting, billing and staff management system. Due to the difficulty of
converting a django 3.2 app into an offline desktop application, this project will be redone using php (It will provide me a chance
to learn php)
